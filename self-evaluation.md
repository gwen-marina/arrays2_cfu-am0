# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

 I feel slightly confident in my understanding and fluency of the 'each' method. My stumbling block is that I need to realize that on some of the challenges and codes I worked through, we're building on what we learned, so there will be 'if' statements involved and other steps needed. I sometimes forget that I'm building on what I'm learning and take it to literally.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Today was a productive struggle. I actually even stepped away from desk to not struggle! Which was a huge win for me, because I tend to want to push through and that is how I become unproductive in my struggle. I went outside. I even just took my laptop in another room, and that helped me kind of get a new perspective for some reason. I had success while Googling, so I'm actually really proud of that because that's how I learned to use the Math.sqrt.


- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice and learn everything is how I feel. I need to practice building on what I learned, but that is something I could challenge myself to do during the weekend. I don't have to try to learn and memorize everything.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I still need to better learn how to use different methods in Ruby to build code. Not take everything so literal, like I can only use the each method when solving an each problem, and learn that I'm building things one line at a time. That seems so basic and I like I should already know that, but I need to remind myself and Google what I struggle with.
